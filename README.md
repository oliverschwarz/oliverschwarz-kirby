# oliverschwarz-kirby

This is a repository to host my personal website backend based on the cm system Kirby. It contains the templates and chunks that I need in the backend to run the site.

## Structure

I will track only the required backend resources to run the site. This usually contains the `assets/` and the `site/` directory. It does *not* contain the content of the site. Maybe I'll do that later. So let's have a look at the structure.

* `assets/`
  * htaccess - the htaccess file, contains server config & security/data privacy measures
  * `css/` - contains the layout (incl. normalize.css)
* site/
  * `snippets/` - contains all the snippets used throughout the website
  * `templates/` - contains all existing templates
