# oliverschwarz-kirby

This is a repository to host my personal website backend based on the cm system Kirby. It contains the templates and chunks that I need in the backend to run the site.

## Structure

I will track only the required backend resources to run the site. This usually contains the `assets/` and the `site/` directory.
